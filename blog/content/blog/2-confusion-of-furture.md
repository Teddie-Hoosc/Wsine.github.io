Summary: Something confusion in my mind

As a junior student in high school, there is only one lesson in a week. How to say about the life, leisure? In fact, feeling more boring.

Faced with two choices, work or to be a graduate student? This is a difficult choice, because once make a choice, it will decide what the furture look like in a decade. If I choose to work, i need to seek for a internship as quickly, be early familiar with the real face of the real work. If I choose to graduate school, I have to do a good research and publish paper so as to earn a position of enrolling in graduation. As for me, I feel so regret for the last two year, feel regret not to try hard more, feel regret by some idea of relaxing occupied the brain. As a result, the situation becomes high fragmentation, low not.  Therefore, no matter what kind of choice to make, the furture will be much difficult.

However, life still has to continue, despite the complaints, despite the hardships. If I choose to be a graduate student, I want to be able to leave SYSU and go to a better school. If I choose to work, I would rather work in a big company and work hard for three years. If I were powerful enough, I want to create my own operating studio with the help of a group of like-minded companions, do something what I love to do.

To the furture of myself, come on!
