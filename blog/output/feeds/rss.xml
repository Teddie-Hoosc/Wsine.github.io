I would just the make a summary of this month.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In May, many excellent students are writing postgraduate recommendation letters to join the summer camp. As for my not good enough score, I clearly know about the reality. If I would like to be a graduate student, I need to take part in the postgraduate entrance exam. How different are between a graduate student and a working boy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To find out the answer, I need to join the real work environment to explore what it real is. What is the KPI? What is the difference between society and school? I can strongly feel that the answer is over there. What I need to do is just go. Making a internship is not difficult as I thought. Only if you work hard you can do it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In May, I read three books. "C plus plus primer plus", "Study Linux with Aming" and "Core Python programming". When you are confused, your aim is to find out your target. Still studying is a best choice. At least I won't be beaten as quickly in the feature.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No more other words...(how to improve my english=.=)&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Wsine</dc:creator><pubDate>Tue, 31 May 2016 00:00:00 -0500</pubDate><guid>tag:Wsine.github.io,2016-05-31:blog/2016/05/31/make-a-decision.html</guid></item><item><title>Confusion of the furture</title><link>http://Wsine.github.io/blog/2016/03/03/confusion-of-furture.html</link><description>&lt;p&gt;As a junior student in high school, there is only one lesson in a week. How to say about the life, leisure? In fact, feeling more boring.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Faced with two choices, work or to be a graduate student? This is a difficult choice, because once make a choice, it will decide what the furture look like in a decade. If I choose to work, i need to seek for a internship as quickly, be early familiar with the real face of the real work. If I choose to graduate school, I have to do a good research and publish paper so as to earn a position of enrolling in graduation. As for me, I feel so regret for the last two year, feel regret not to try hard more, feel regret by some idea of relaxing occupied the brain. As a result, the situation becomes high fragmentation, low not.  Therefore, no matter what kind of choice to make, the furture will be much difficult.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, life still has to continue, despite the complaints, despite the hardships. If I choose to be a graduate student, I want to be able to leave SYSU and go to a better school. If I choose to work, I would rather work in a big company and work hard for three years. If I were powerful enough, I want to create my own operating studio with the help of a group of like-minded companions, do something what I love to do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To the furture of myself, come on!&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Wsine</dc:creator><pubDate>Thu, 03 Mar 2016 00:00:00 -0600</pubDate><guid>tag:Wsine.github.io,2016-03-03:blog/2016/03/03/confusion-of-furture.html</guid></item><item><title>First Blog</title><link>http://Wsine.github.io/blog/2016/02/08/first-blog.html</link><description>&lt;p&gt;Thanks Github page, pelican, and crowsfoot theme.
