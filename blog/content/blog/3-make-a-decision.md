Summary: dont know what to do just learning and watching

It is the last day of May. I would just the make a summary of this month.

In May, many excellent students are writing postgraduate recommendation letters to join the summer camp. As for my not good enough score, I clearly know about the reality. If I would like to be a graduate student, I need to take part in the postgraduate entrance exam. How different are between a graduate student and a working boy.

To find out the answer, I need to join the real work environment to explore what it real is. What is the KPI? What is the difference between society and school? I can strongly feel that the answer is over there. What I need to do is just go. Making a internship is not difficult as I thought. Only if you work hard you can do it.

In May, I read three books. "C plus plus primer plus", "Study Linux with Aming" and "Core Python programming". When you are confused, your aim is to find out your target. Still studying is a best choice. At least I won't be beaten as quickly in the feature.

No more other words...(how to improve my english=.=)
