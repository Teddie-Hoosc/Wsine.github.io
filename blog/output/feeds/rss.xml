How to say about the life, leisure? In fact, feeling more boring.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Faced with two choices, work or to be a graduate student? This is a difficult choice, because once make a choice, it will decide what the furture look like in a decade. If I choose to work, i need to seek for a internship as quickly, be early familiar with the real face of the real work. If I choose to graduate school, I have to do a good research and publish paper so as to earn a position of enrolling in graduation. As for me, I feel so regret for the last two year, feel regret not to try hard more, feel regret by some idea of relaxing occupied the brain. As a result, the situation becomes high fragmentation, low not.  Therefore, no matter what kind of choice to make, the furture will be much difficult.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, life still has to continue, despite the complaints, despite the hardships. If I choose to be a graduate student, I want to be able to leave SYSU and go to a better school. If I choose to work, I would rather work in a big company and work hard for three years. If I were powerful enough, I want to create my own operating studio with the help of a group of like-minded companions, do something what I love to do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To the furture of myself, come on!&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Wsine</dc:creator><pubDate>Thu, 03 Mar 2016 00:00:00 -0600</pubDate><guid>tag:Wsine.github.io,2016-03-03:blog/2016/03/03/confusion-of-furture.html</guid></item><item><title>First Blog</title><link>http://Wsine.github.io/blog/2016/02/08/first-blog.html</link><description>&lt;p&gt;Thanks Github page, pelican, and crowsfoot theme.
